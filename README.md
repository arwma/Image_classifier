<h2>K Means Clustering Algorithm:</h2>

K Means is a clustering algorithm. Clustering algorithms are unsupervised algorithms which means that there is no labelled data available. It is used to identify different classes or clusters in the given data based on how similar the data is. Data points in the same group are more similar to other data points in that same group than those in other groups.
